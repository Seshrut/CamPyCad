<h2>
  What is CamPyCad?
</h2>
<h4>
  CamPyCad is a Python project that uses your camera to scan a circuit diagram. It then leverages computer vision and machine learning techniques to identify components and calculate currents and voltages.
</h4>
<h3>
Key features:
</h3>
<h4>
<i>Component recognition:</i> Accurately identifies components like resistors, capacitors, and inductors.<br>
<i>Circuit analysis:</i> Calculates currents and voltages using Kirchhoff's laws and Ohm's law.
